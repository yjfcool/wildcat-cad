Wildcat is designed to run on modern Mac and Windows machines.  It makes heavy use of 3D hardware acceleration and as such its most significant requirements are for the graphics card.  Listed below are the requirements necessary for running the application:

**For Windows Systems**

  * Windows XP SP2
  * Pentium 4 class processor or better (1.5GHz+ preferred)
  * At least 50MB of disk space
  * At least 1GB of RAM
  * OpenGL 2.1 capable video card with 128MB of RAM

**Note**: The graphics card requirement is the most important.  All aspects of Wildcat presume that you have a relatively recent video card and up-to-date OpenGL drivers.

**For Mac OS X**

  * OS X 10.5 Leopard (Tiger may work, but I have not tried)
  * Intel 32/64-bit processor
  * At least 50MB of disk space
  * At least 1GB of RAM
  * OpenGL 2.1 capable video card with 128MB of RAM

**Note**: Apple provides a software fallback path for machines that don't have compatible video cards.  While I have not tested this, it should at least make it so that all Intel Macs can run Wildcat.

**Example Development and Testing Setup**

Just to help folks out on what I am working with and to give you an idea of what should work here are the two systems I use on a daily basis:

**Primary Development**
  * Apple MacBook Pro
  * OS X 10.5.3
  * 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor
  * 2GB RAM
  * 40GB HD partition
  * nVidia GeForce 8600M GT w/ 256MB video RAM
  * XCode 3.1 development environment

**Windows Development**
  * MS Windows XP SP 2
  * 2.2 GHZ Intel Core 2 Duo processor
  * 2GB RAM
  * 160GB HD partition
  * ATI Radeon HD 2400 XT w/258MB video RAM
  * MS Visual Studio 2005 development environment
