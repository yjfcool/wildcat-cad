# Creating a 2D Sketch #

In this tutorial you will be guided through creating a simple 2D sketch.  Sketches are fundamental to creating 3D solid models in Wildcat.  Nearly all 3D geometry starts with sketches.  Before you can create a sketch you must have a **Plane** on which to draw the sketch.


# Steps #

  1. Start Wildcat CAD
  1. If you are on OS X, select **Part Doc** - For Windows this is the default
  1. Select one of the three existing planes (XY plane, YZ plane, ZX plane)
  1. Either press the 's' key or click the Sketch icon from the toolbar
  1. The viewpoint will orient itself to the coordinate system of the sketch
  1. To exit back to 3D press 'q' - you should see **Sketch.1** listed in the specification tree
