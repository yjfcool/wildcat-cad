# Wildcat Workbenches #

Workbenches are a fundamental concept in Wildcat CAD.  This concept did not originate here, you can easy see the same idea in nearly all major CAD applications.  Workbenches create a logical breakdown of modeling tools into similar categories.

Each workbench fully encapsulates its own tools, user-interface elements, documentation, and modeling functionality.  All workbenches are built using the foundation provided by the Core Workbench.  The Core workbench does not directly provide any end-user functionality itself but simply enables other workbenches to function.

Listed below are the initial set of workbenches that will be incorporated into Wildcat (those that have an implementation have links to their documentation):

  * Part Design
  * [Sketcher](Sketcher.md)
  * Real-Time Visualization
  * Assembly
  * Drafting
